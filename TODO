The FORTRANish mess that once was is now mostly idiomatic C. Some issues
remain to be cleaned up:

* More possible vase tests:
  DROP VASE in the well house and confirm that you do/don't get points for it;
  die while carrying the vase and confirm that it doesn't break.

* We are aware that the lamp currently used as the project logo is a
  hurricane lamp, not a proper miner's lamp. Submissions of potential
  replacement images would be welcome.
