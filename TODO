= Open Adventure TODO =

* Update the command parser to accept a PRNG seed value.

* Add command logging and command log replay.  Note that the replay log
  needs to begin with the random-number seed.

* Use that feature to make regression tests from walkthroughs.

* Add command-line option to disable all extension features.  First
  extension features: (1) Command prompt, (2) initial resource-allocation
  number display suppressed.

* Translate the FORTRANish mess to actual C.

* Inline the database so the code doesn't need an external file.
